After running the tests timeline report will be generated inside the project under `./reports/timeline`. Also, this location will be given in the terminal after the execution of the tests/suite, like -
```

Timeline report also shows the screenshots in the report based on `screenshotStrategy: 'before:click'`. 

> Note: On each run all the previous reports and screenshots will be deleted and new reports will be created.
