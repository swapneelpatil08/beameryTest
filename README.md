# Project Structure

## Tests
Spec files are placed in directory `./test/specs/`. Currently this project has 3 spec files and total of 9 tests, coveinng positive and negative scenarios.

## Page Objects
This framework use Page Object Model _(aka POM)_, design pattern that creates object repository for storing web elements. Page Objects are located at `./test/pageobjects/`.

## Test data
Static test data is kept under `./test/testdata/` directory. They are stored as a javascript objects. This is single point of test data source.

## Configuration file
This project uses config file `wdio.conf.js` which is under `./config/` directory. Here we have added all the configuration needed for this project, like - 
```Javascript
    baseUrl: 'http://automationpractice.com/',
    services: ['chromedriver', 'devtools', 'image-comparison', [TimelineService]],
    reporters: [
        'spec',
        ['timeline',
            {
                outputDir: './reports/timeline',
                filename: 'timeline-report.html',
                embededImages: true,
                screenshotStrategy: 'before:click'
            }]
        ],
```
> Note: By default chrome driver will be used for the execution. 

## Locators 
In this project below locator strategies are used:
1. _id_
2. _xPath_
3. _css locators_

### Timeline report
![timeline-report](https://i.imgur.com/cMvkXAV_d.webp?maxwidth=1520&fidelity=grand)

After running the tests timeline report will be generated inside the project under `./reports/timeline`. Also, this location will be given in the terminal after the execution of the tests/suite, like -
```
--------
TIMELINE REPORTER: Created /Users/**/Documents/Personal/TestBeam/webdriverIO-Javascript/reports/timeline/timeline-report.html
--------
```
Timeline report also shows the screenshots in the report based on `screenshotStrategy: 'before:click'`. 

> Note: On each run all the previous reports and screenshots will be deleted and new reports will be created.
